# Company Services RESTful API
A RESTful web service built with Node.js that performs CRUD on a campus database.

## Usage
- `npm install`
- `node server.js`

## Notes
The project uses `nodemon` to live reload the server whenever a change has been made. If you wish to use this module, `npm install -g nodemon` before `npm start`. Otherwise, `node server.js` starts the project.

There is an included postman collections json file to import to `Postman` to test the API.
